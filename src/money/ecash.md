# Ecash

Designed to remove the double spending problem. In traditional Ecash, the bank creates a coin, i.e., a digital representation of a coin with a unique serial number on it. It then gives the coin with the serial number to Alice, and Alice can prove the bank produced the coin using something called digital signatures (we will explore them later). Alice gives the coin to Bob and gets the sandwich, and Bob goes back to the bank, and the bank confirms the serial number has not been spent. The problem with this is the bank has to be online.
