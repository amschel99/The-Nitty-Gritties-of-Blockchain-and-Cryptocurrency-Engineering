# Signatures indepth

Apart from hash based Signatures(lamport signature scheme) there are other cool signatures. Hash based signatures are not used in bitcoin.

#### Disadvantages of lamport signatures

1. One time use
2. They are kind of huge (8kilobytes for a signature and keys are 16 kilobytes)

### Ellptic curve signatures

Curves of the form y^2= x^3+ax+b
Bitcoin curve's is y^2= x^3+7
